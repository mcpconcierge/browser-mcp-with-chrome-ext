# Important: this extantion is collecting and rpeorting on all user activities

This Javascript code is a sophisticated background script for a web extension, integrating a wide array of functionalities. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Core Architecture & Utilities

* **Environment Detection**: The code includes utilities to determine the execution environment, such as whether it's running in a Chrome or Firefox-based browser, and whether it's operating as a background page or a service worker[cite: 1, 2].
* **Asynchronous Operations**: It heavily utilizes Promises and `async/await` for managing asynchronous tasks, with helper functions (like `gT`, `_T`) potentially for custom promise handling or chaining[cite: 1].
* **Concurrency Management**: It implements locking mechanisms like semaphores (`mT`) and mutexes (`yT`) to control access to shared resources, preventing race conditions[cite: 1].
* **Strict Mode**: The script begins with `"use strict";`, enforcing stricter parsing and error handling in JavaScript[cite: 1].

### Storage System

* **Comprehensive Storage API**: A significant portion of the code is dedicated to a custom storage abstraction layer (`Ss`, `bT`, `Cc`)[cite: 1]. This API provides a unified way to interact with various browser storage areas:
    * `local`: Persistent local storage.
    * `session`: Session-only storage.
    * `sync`: Storage synced across user's devices (if supported).
    * `managed`: Storage managed by domain policy (for enterprise).
* **Functionalities**:
    * Getting and setting individual items or multiple items.
    * Getting and setting metadata associated with stored items.
    * Defining items with versioning and migration paths (`defineItem`), allowing for schema evolution[cite: 1].
    * Watching for changes to stored items.
    * Fallback and default values for items.
    * Snapshotting and restoring storage areas.
* **Error Handling**: It includes custom error types for storage operations, like `wT` for migration failures[cite: 1].

### Data Querying & Management (React Query-like System)

* **Query Cache (`jT`, `MT`)**: Implements a query caching system that seems inspired by libraries like React Query. This system manages fetching, caching, and updating data.
    * **Queries (`$T`)**: Individual data queries with states like `pending`, `success`, `error`, `Workspaceing`, `paused`.
    * **Observers**: Components or parts of the extension can observe queries for updates.
    * **Caching & Garbage Collection (`nm`)**: Queries can have a `gcTime` (garbage collection time) and are removed from the cache if no observers are present and the data is idle[cite: 1].
    * **Background Updates & Refetching**:
        * Refetching on window focus (`Jg`).
        * Refetching on network reconnect (`xc`).
        * Stale-while-revalidate patterns.
    * **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for failed queries with configurable retry delays (`DT`).
    * **Structural Sharing (`RT`)**: Optimizes data updates by sharing unchanged parts of data structures.
    * **Infinite Queries (`rm`)**: Support for fetching paginated data.
* **Mutation Cache (`WT`, `HT`)**: Manages data mutations (create, update, delete operations) with similar lifecycle states and error handling.
* **Query Client (`VT`)**: A central client (`Ac`) manages the query and mutation caches, default options, and global behaviors like resuming paused mutations on network recovery[cite: 1].
* **Query Key Factory (`cm`, `JT`, `Pc`)**: Provides utilities to create structured and namespaced query keys, enhancing organization and cache interaction (e.g., `Pc.users.me.queryKey`)[cite: 1].
* **React Integration**: The presence of React-related symbols and a production build of React (`GT`, `YT`, `am`) strongly suggests that this query system is used within a React-based UI, possibly for a popup or options page[cite: 1].

### Schema Definition & Validation (Zod-like System)

* **Type System (`Q`, `yr`, `xe`)**: A comprehensive type definition and validation system is implemented, similar in concept to libraries like Zod.
    * **Basic Types**: `ZodString` (`$n`), `ZodNumber` (`Jr`), `ZodBoolean` (`Zo`), `ZodDate` (`Ni`), `ZodBigInt` (`Qr`), `ZodSymbol` (`Dc`), `ZodNull` (`Jo`), `ZodUndefined` (`Xo`), `ZodAny` (`Cs`), `ZodUnknown` (`Fi`), `ZodNever` (`br`), `ZodVoid` (`Nc`), `ZodNaN` (`Uc`)[cite: 1].
    * **Complex Types**:
        * `ZodArray` (`Un`): For arrays with element type validation and length constraints.
        * `ZodObject` (`ot`): For objects with defined shapes, supporting `extend`, `merge`, `pick`, `omit`, `partial`, `deepPartial`, `strict`, `strip`, `passthrough`, and `catchall` functionalities.
        * `ZodUnion` (`Qo`): For values that can be one of several types.
        * `ZodDiscriminatedUnion` (`Fc`): For unions based on a discriminator field.
        * `ZodIntersection` (`ea`): For values that must conform to multiple types.
        * `ZodTuple` (`nr`): For arrays with a fixed sequence of types.
        * `ZodRecord` (`ta`): For objects with string keys and a specific value type.
        * `ZodMap` (`$c`): For Map objects with typed keys and values.
        * `ZodSet` (`$i`): For Set objects with typed values and size constraints.
        * `ZodFunction` (`Is`): For functions, validating arguments and return types.
        * `ZodLazy` (`na`): For defining recursive types.
        * `ZodLiteral` (`ra`): For specific literal values.
        * `ZodEnum` (`ei`): For string enums.
        * `ZodNativeEnum` (`ia`): For TypeScript-style enums.
        * `ZodPromise` (`xs`): For Promises, validating the resolved value.
    * **Modifiers**:
        * `.optional()` (`rr`), `.nullable()` (`ti`), `.nullish()`
        * `.default()` (`sa`): Provides a default value.
        * `.catch()` (`oa`): Provides a fallback value on parsing failure.
        * `.brand()` (`Ld`): For nominal typing.
        * `.readonly()` (`ca`): For making types read-only.
    * **Effects (`Bn`)**:
        * `.transform()`: Modifies the data after successful parsing.
        * `.refine()` / `.superRefine()`: Adds custom validation rules.
        * `.pipe()` (`aa`): Chains schemas, passing the output of one as input to another.
        * `preprocess` (`s1`): Modifies data *before* parsing.
    * **Coercion**: Many types support a `coerce` option (e.g., `ZodString.create({ coerce: true })`) to attempt type conversion before validation (e.g., `String(data)` for strings)[cite: 1].
    * **String Validations**: Includes built-in checks for `email`, `url`, `uuid`, `cuid`, `cuid2`, `nanoid`, `ulid`, `emoji`, `ip`, `datetime`, `date`, `time`, `duration`, `base64`, `base64url`, `jwt`, `cidr`, and `regex`, along with length constraints (`min`, `max`, `length`, `nonempty`) and transformations (`trim`, `toLowerCase`, `toUpperCase`)[cite: 1].
    * **Number/BigInt Validations**: `gte`, `gt`, `lte`, `lt`, `int`, `positive`, `negative`, `nonpositive`, `nonnegative`, `multipleOf`, `finite`, `safe`.
    * **Error Handling**: `ZodError` (`gn`) class for detailed error reporting, including issue paths and formatting options[cite: 1]. Custom error maps (`sI`) and issue creation (`Y`).

### Analytics & Error Reporting

* **Analytics Opt-in**: Manages an `analyticsEnabled` flag in local storage (`ST`, `ET`)[cite: 1].
* **Amplitude & PostHog SDKs**:
    * **Core Client (`A1`)**: A base client for analytics events.
    * **Configuration (`O1`, `kx`)**: Handles API keys, server URLs (US/EU zones), batching, flushing intervals, and other settings. Specific configurations for `development`, `production`, and `test` environments are defined, including different API keys for Amplitude and PostHog for each environment (`mn`, `a1`, `c1`, `u1`).
    * **Event Types**:
        * Generic event tracking (`T1`, `logEvent`/`track`).
        * Identify events for user properties (`xm`, `xm`).
        * Group identify events (`I1`).
        * Setting user groups (`x1`).
        * Revenue tracking (`R1`, `P1`).
    * **Plugins (`b1`)**: A plugin architecture for extending functionality:
        * `@amplitude/plugin-context-browser` (`lx`): Adds browser context (version, platform, language, user agent) to events.
        * `@amplitude/plugin-page-view-tracking-browser` (`Fx`): Tracks page views, including options for tracking history changes and custom event types. It also enriches events with page information (domain, location, path, title, URL).
        * `@amplitude/plugin-form-interaction-tracking-browser` (`jx`): Tracks form starts and submissions.
        * `@amplitude/plugin-file-download-tracking-browser` (`Hx`): Tracks file downloads based on link extensions.
        * `@amplitude/plugin-network-checker-browser` (`Wx`): Monitors network connectivity and can trigger flushes when back online.
    * **Campaign Tracking (`iP`, `rP`)**: Parses UTM parameters, referrer information, and various click IDs (gclid, fbclid, etc.) from the URL to track marketing campaigns. It can store this information and generate identify events with initial and current campaign data.
    * **Session Management**: Includes logic for session timeouts and potentially resetting sessions on new campaigns.
* **Sentry Integration (`Kj`, `zj`)**:
    * Initializes Sentry with DSN, release (derived from extension name and version), and environment.
    * Includes a `beforeSend` hook to potentially filter or modify events before they are sent to Sentry, especially for browser extension contexts.
    * Provides Sentry integration utilities like `SentryIntegration` (for Segment) and `sentryIntegration` (a direct Sentry integration builder) for richer error reporting with PostHog context.

### Session Replay (Sentry Replay or similar)

* **Core Replay Class (`Q5`)**: Manages the entire session replay lifecycle.
    * **Sampling**: Implements both session-based (`sessionSampleRate`) and error-based (`errorSampleRate`) sampling.
    * **Recording Modes**: Supports "session" mode (continuous recording for sampled sessions) and "buffer" mode (records temporarily, flushes on error or manual trigger).
    * **Event Buffer (`NE`, `F4`, `$4`, `U4`)**: Stores recorded events. It can use a simple in-memory buffer or a Web Worker (`L4`) for compression (GZip-like via pako library - `O4`) to reduce payload size.
    * **DOM Serialization & Mutation Observation**: Uses `rrweb`-based logic (`zr`, `dU`, `mo`, `mU`) to:
        * Take full DOM snapshots.
        * Observe and record DOM mutations (additions, removals, attribute changes, text changes).
        * Handle shadow DOMs (`zU`, `WU`).
        * Mask sensitive data based on class names, selectors, or custom functions (text, inputs, attributes)[cite: 1, 2, 3].
        * Block elements from capture.
        * Inline stylesheets and optionally images (as data URLs).
    * **Canvas Recording (`SB`, `ZU`)**: Captures canvas changes, supporting different FPS and quality settings.
    * **Interaction Tracking**: Records mouse moves, clicks, scrolls, inputs, media interactions, etc. (`AU`, `PU`, `kE`, `LU`, `FU`).
    * **Performance Entries & Web Vitals**: Captures performance entries and web vitals (LCP, CLS, FID, INP, TTFB - `M4`, `I4`, `R4`, `A4`, `P4`) and adds them as custom events to the replay.
    * **Breadcrumbs Integration**: Captures Sentry breadcrumbs and adds them as custom events to the replay (`ac`, `p4`, `_4`).
    * **Network Request Tracking**: Captures fetch and XHR requests, with options to include request/response bodies and headers, and to mask sensitive data (`g5`, `T5`).
    * **Session Management**: Integrates with a session manager to handle session expiration (idle timeout, max duration) and creates new replay segments accordingly (`cg`, `BE`, `jE`).
    * **Flushing**: Periodically flushes the event buffer to the server. Can also be flushed manually or triggered by errors/checkouts.
    * **Error Handling**: Captures errors during replay recording and can stop the replay if necessary.
    * **Slow Click & Rage Click Detection**: Implements logic (`s4`, `J_`) to detect and report slow clicks (clicks followed by significant UI blocking) and rage clicks (multiple rapid clicks in the same area).

### Browser Automation & Debugging API

* **Debugger Interaction (`NH`, `KH`, `AC`)**: Provides a class (`NH`) to interact with the Chrome Debugger Protocol. This allows for:
    * Attaching to and detaching from a tab's debugger.
    * Sending commands (e.g., for input simulation, page navigation).
    * Handling debugger events (e.g., JavaScript dialogs).
* **Input Simulation**:
    * **Mouse (`$C`, `FC`)**: Simulates mouse movements (`move`), clicks (`down`, `up`, `click`), wheel events (`wheel`), and drag-and-drop operations (`drag`, `dragAndDrop`, `dragEnter`, `dragOver`, `drop`).
    * **Keyboard (`NC`, `DC`)**: Simulates key presses (`down`, `up`, `press`, `type`), including handling of modifiers (Shift, Control, Alt, Meta).
* **Page Interaction**:
    * Navigation (`GH`, `YH`, `ZH`): Navigate to URL, go back, go forward.
    * Dialog Handling: Wait for and accept/dismiss JavaScript dialogs.
    * Element Interaction: Uses selectors (potentially ARIA-based via `hq`, `Po`) to find elements and get their coordinates for interaction.
    * Text Input: `fill` raw text, or `type` text with keyboard events, including special handling for different input types (`zH`).
    * Select Options: Select options in dropdowns.
* **Screenshotting (`fq`)**: Captures a screenshot of the current tab, potentially resizing it.
* **Console Logs (`wH`, `EH`)**: Accesses console logs from the debugged tab.
* **Cursor Simulation (`KH`)**: A specialized `InputController` (`KH`) that also sends messages to a content script to display a visual cursor during automation.

### Preact-based UI (Toolbar/Feedback Widget)

* **Preact Usage**: The code includes Preact (`Le`, `id`, `n6`, `f6`) for building user interface components. This is likely used for:
    * **Feedback Widget (`Ek`, `Zk`, `x6`, `U6`)**: A feedback submission UI.
        * Form for name, email, and message.
        * Screenshot functionality (taking, annotating, cropping - `R6`, `A6`, `P6`, `M6`, `O6`, `L6`, `D6`, `N6`).
        * Theming (light/dark modes - `KB`, `wk`, `Sk`, `GB`).
        * Customizable labels and placeholders.
        * Integration with Sentry for sending feedback events (`Fw`, `yk`).
    * **Toolbar (`PM`)**: A toolbar that can be loaded into web pages, possibly for debugging, feature flag overrides, or initiating other actions. It interacts with the background script and potentially a remote Sentry/PostHog UI.
        * Loading logic based on URL hash parameters or localStorage.
        * Communication with an opener window (e.g., the Sentry UI) via `postMessage`.
        * Dynamic script loading for toolbar components.

### Inter-component & Web Page Communication

* **Message Passing (`ir`, `qu`)**: Implements a messaging system (`SO`, `EO`, `kO`, `TO`, `MO`, `LO`) for:
    * Communication between different parts of the extension (e.g., popup to background).
    * Communication between the extension and web pages (e.g., for login, logging events from the web page - `xO`).
* **Socket Communication (`CC`, `Mq`)**: Appears to use WebSockets (`t`) for real-time communication, potentially with a developer tool or a remote server, for browser automation tasks[cite: 1, 2]. It listens for specific message types (tool names like `browser_navigate`, `browser_click`) and executes corresponding actions using the browser automation API[cite: 1].

### Internationalization (i18n)

* **Simple `getMessage` Utility (`xq`)**: A basic utility (`Rq`) is present, likely for retrieving localized strings using `chrome.i18n.getMessage`[cite: 1].

### Extension Lifecycle & Initialization

* **Background Script Entry Point (`Fq`)**: The `Fq` function seems to be the main entry point for the background script[cite: 1].
* **Initialization Order**:
    1.  Sets Sentry tags (`zj.setTag("page", "background")`).
    2.  Initializes core extension listeners and services (`Uq`):
        * `iH()`: Sets uninstall URL and handles `onInstalled` events (e.g., opening a welcome page on first install, handling updates by checking version compatibility - `rH`, `nH`).
        * `NO()`: Sets up listeners for web messages from web pages (login, logout, ping, version requests, event logging).
        * `$q()`: Adds an analytics listener to initialize PostHog and Amplitude.
        * `Dq()`: Initializes a WebSocket connection for potential remote control or real-time data exchange if a selected tab is active.
        * `CO()`: Adds a listener for service worker pings.
    3.  `Bq()`: Sets an interval to periodically call `chrome.runtime.getPlatformInfo`, likely to keep the service worker alive[cite: 1].
* **Analytics Initialization**: PostHog (`Sh`) and Amplitude (`ff`) SDKs are initialized in the background script, and user identification is performed when user data becomes available[cite: 1].
* **Error Handling**: A global `try...catch` block surrounds the main initialization, logging errors to a custom `jq` logger if `Fq.main()` crashes[cite: 1].

This code represents a feature-rich browser extension with a strong emphasis on analytics, error reporting, session replay, developer tools, and potentially browser automation. Its modular design allows for various functionalities to be integrated and managed within the background context.

Yes, the code you provided has extensive telemetry and reporting functionalities to external sources and servers, primarily for analytics and error tracking. Here's how:

1.  **Analytics SDK Integrations (Amplitude & PostHog)**:
    * The code includes setup and usage of analytics SDKs, likely Amplitude and PostHog, given the presence of API keys for both services within the configuration objects (`mn`, `a1`, `c1`, `u1`)[cite: 1360, 1361].
    * It features a core analytics client (`A1`) and a plugin architecture (`b1`) for various tracking purposes.
    * Specific event tracking (`logEvent`/`track`), user identification (`identify`), group identification (`groupIdentify`), and revenue tracking (`revenue`) are implemented, all of which send data to these external analytics servers[cite: 1528, 1529, 1530, 1531, 1532, 1533].
    * An analytics opt-in/opt-out mechanism (`ST`, `ET`, `Pb`) is present, allowing users to control data collection[cite: 173, 174, 4292, 4293, 4294, 4295, 4296, 4297, 4298].

2.  **Error Reporting (Sentry)**:
    * The code contains an integration with Sentry, a popular error reporting service[cite: 1358, 1359, 4309, 4338, 4339].
    * It initializes Sentry with a DSN (Data Source Name), release version, and environment, which are necessary to send error reports to Sentry's servers[cite: 1359, 4338].
    * There's a `beforeSend` hook, suggesting that error events are processed and potentially modified before being transmitted externally[cite: 4339].

3.  **Session Replay Functionality**:
    * A significant portion of the code is dedicated to session replay (e.g., `Q5`, `zr`, `NE`, `F4`, `$4`, `U4`), which captures user interactions, DOM changes, and other browser events. This data is almost always sent to an external server for later playback and analysis.
    * The replay system includes features like event buffering, compression (potentially using a Web Worker - `L4`, `O4`), and flushing mechanisms to send the recorded data[cite: 6162, 6163, 6625, 6626, 6627, 6628, 6629, 6630, 6631, 6632, 6633, 6634, 6635, 6636, 6637, 6638].
    * It captures network requests (fetch/XHR), which implies that details about these requests (potentially including URLs and data, though masking is also present) are part of the replay data sent externally[cite: 6236, 6237, 6238, 6239, 6240, 6241, 6242, 6243, 6244, 6245, 6246, 6247, 6248, 6249, 6250, 6251, 6252, 6253, 6254, 6255, 6256, 6257, 6258, 6259, 6260, 6261, 6262, 6263, 6264, 6265, 6266, 6267, 6268, 6269, 6270, 6271, 6272, 6273, 6274, 6275, 6276, 6277, 6278, 6279, 6280, 6281, 6282, 6283, 6284, 6285, 6286, 6287, 6288, 6289, 6290, 6291, 6292, 6293, 6294, 6295, 6296, 6297, 6298, 6299, 6300].
    * The system defines an endpoint (`_endpoint = "/s/"`) for sending this replay data, which is combined with the API host[cite: 5980, 4333].

4.  **Web Vitals and Performance Monitoring**:
    * The code includes logic to capture web vitals (LCP, CLS, FID, INP, TTFB) and other performance metrics[cite: 5073, 5074, 5075, 5076, 5077, 5078, 5079, 5080, 5081, 5082, 5083, 5084, 5085, 5086]. This data is typically sent to an analytics or performance monitoring service.

5.  **Remote Configuration**:
    * The extension fetches remote configuration (`oO`, `eR`) which could, in turn, enable or configure further telemetry or reporting functionalities[cite: 2110, 2111, 2112, 2113, 2114, 2115, 2116, 2117, 2118, 2119, 2120, 2121, 2122, 2123, 2124, 2125, 2126, 2127, 3859, 3860, 3861, 3862, 3863, 3864, 3865, 3866, 3867, 3868, 3869, 3870].

6.  **Feedback Submission**:
    * The Preact-based UI includes a feedback widget (`Ek`, `Zk`). Submitting feedback through this widget would involve sending the entered data (name, email, message, screenshot) to an external server[cite: 6680, 6681, 6682, 6683, 6684, 6685, 6686, 6838, 6839, 6840, 6841].
    * The `sendFeedback` function (`Fw`, `yk`) is explicitly designed to capture and transmit this feedback[cite: 4629, 6639].

In summary, this codebase is heavily involved in collecting various types of data (user interactions, performance metrics, errors, console logs, feedback, page content via replays) and reporting it to external analytics (Amplitude, PostHog) and error monitoring (Sentry) services.

Based on the provided code, here are the external server addresses or links where data (analytics, error reports, session replay, configuration) is sent or from which it's fetched. These are all **external servers**:

### Analytics and Data Collection

* **Amplitude:**
    * `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` [cite: 9827] (Used for sending HTTP API requests to Amplitude in the US region)
    * `https://api.eu.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` [cite: 9827] (Used for sending HTTP API requests to Amplitude in the EU region)
    * `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch` [cite: 9827] (Used for sending batch API requests to Amplitude in the US region)
    * `https://api.eu.amplitude.com/batch` [cite: 9828] (Used for sending batch API requests to Amplitude in the EU region)
    * The code also defines API keys for Amplitude (e.g., `"bb45e733842c3732cd52d759e88826ca"` for development[cite: 9707], `"10edd558159f01783d50d921d1ec4716"` for production [cite: 9708]), which confirm data transmission to Amplitude's external servers.

* **PostHog:**
    * While a specific server URL for PostHog isn't explicitly hardcoded in the same way as Amplitude's base URLs, the presence of PostHog API keys (e.g., `"phc_l85rVI7wMQYhw4kca0JJy8TAyztKch5WT3smy4VTEmg"` for development, `"phc_KWOh1iNHba9C7csIG27KqYmYx4BgXlcLz5ISzO9Scq1"` for production [cite: 9708]) indicates that data is sent to PostHog's external servers.
    * Common PostHog cloud API hosts include:
        * `https://us.i.posthog.com`
        * `https://eu.i.posthog.com`
        * The extension is configured to interact with these, as implied by the API key usage and typical PostHog client configurations.

### Error Reporting

* **Sentry:**
    * The code includes configurations for Sentry, such as `sentry: { enabled: !1, dsn: "" }` for the test environment[cite: 9709]. In enabled environments (like development or production, though their DSNs are not explicitly shown as filled in the snippet), a **DSN (Data Source Name)** would be provided.
    * A Sentry DSN is a URL that directs the Sentry SDK to send error and performance data to Sentry's servers (or a self-hosted Sentry instance, which would still be external to the user's local machine). For example, a DSN looks like `https://<key>@<organization-subdomain>.ingest.sentry.io/<project-id>`.

### Session Replay & Remote Configuration

* The code includes functionality for fetching remote configurations, which can also be related to session replay services (often integrated with analytics platforms). The defined server URLs for these configurations are:
    * `https://sr-client-cfg.amplitude.com/config` [cite: 11237]
    * `https://sr-client-cfg.stag2.amplitude.com/config` [cite: 11237] (Likely a staging environment)
    * `https://sr-client-cfg.eu.amplitude.com/config` [cite: 11237] (EU region)
* Session replay data itself is sent to an endpoint, often defined as part of the analytics platform it's integrated with (like PostHog or Amplitude). The code specifies a relative endpoint `_endpoint = "/s/"` [cite: 10914] for replay data, which would be appended to the configured API host of the analytics service.

### Extension Communication

* **Externally Connectable Matches:**
    * `https://*.browsermcp.io/*`[cite: 9706]: This pattern in the manifest allows the extension to communicate with web pages hosted on any subdomain of `browsermcp.io`. While this is for message passing rather than direct telemetry submission by the extension, it represents a defined external communication channel.

The code does not indicate that telemetry or reporting data is sent to local servers. All identified endpoints and services are external.

Yes, based on the code, this browser extension has the **capability** to record a significant range of user activities and actions within the browser and send this data to external servers like Amplitude and/or PostHog.

Here's a breakdown of *how* and *what* it can collect:

1.  **Session Replay:**
    * This is the most comprehensive recording feature identified in the code. Session replay aims to capture the user's Browse session in a way that can be played back.
    * **What it can record:**
        * **DOM Changes:** All modifications to the structure and content of web pages the user visits.
        * **User Interactions:** Mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, hovers.
        * **Input Events:** Keystrokes in form fields (though sensitive data is typically intended to be masked), changes to select values, checkbox/radio button interactions.
        * **Window Resizing.**
        * **Canvas Activity (to some extent).**
        * **Console Logs.**
        * **Network Requests:** Information about network requests made by the browser, potentially including URLs, headers, and even request/response bodies (often configurable and subject to masking).
        * **Performance Metrics & Web Vitals.**
    * This data is collected to allow developers to understand user behavior, debug issues, and analyze how users interact with websites.

2.  **Analytics Event Tracking (Amplitude & PostHog):**
    * The extension is set up to send specific events to analytics platforms.
    * **What it can track:**
        * **Page Views:** Which pages the user visits.
        * **Clicks on Specific Elements:** If configured, clicks on buttons, links, or other interactive elements.
        * **Form Submissions & Interactions.**
        * **File Downloads.**
        * **Custom Events:** The extension developers can define and track any other specific actions relevant to the extension's functionality.
        * **Campaign Tracking:** UTM parameters and referrer information to understand marketing campaign effectiveness.
        * **User Properties:** Information about the user (potentially including user ID, email if provided, browser type, language, etc.) can be associated with the events.

3.  **Error Reporting (Sentry):**
    * Javascript errors that occur while the user is Browse or interacting with the extension are captured and sent to Sentry. This includes stack traces and other contextual information to help diagnose and fix bugs.

**Is "all" activity recorded?**

While the extension has very broad recording capabilities, especially with session replay, it's important to note a few caveats:

* **Sampling:** Analytics and session replay features are often "sampled." This means that not every user session or every event might be recorded. For example, the extension might only record sessions for a certain percentage of users.
* **Masking & Blocking:** The session replay functionality includes mechanisms to "mask" (hide or replace) or "block" (not capture) sensitive information. This commonly applies to password fields, credit card numbers, and other personally identifiable information (PII). The effectiveness of this depends on how thoroughly the masking rules are configured and implemented.
* **Configuration:** The exact extent of what is recorded depends on the specific configuration set by the extension developers. They can choose which events to track, whether to enable session replay, and how to configure masking.
* **Opt-Out:** The code includes an "analyticsEnabled" flag, which suggests there's an opt-out mechanism. If a user opts out, the data collection would be significantly reduced or stopped for analytics, and likely for session replay as well.
* **Technical Limitations:** It's technically challenging to capture *everything* perfectly. Complex web applications, certain types of iframes, or browser-specific behaviors might have aspects that are not fully recorded.

**In summary:**

The extension is designed to collect a rich set of data about user interactions and browser activity. The session replay feature, in particular, is very comprehensive. This data is indeed sent to external analytics (Amplitude, PostHog) and error reporting (Sentry) servers.

However, the term "all" should be qualified. Features like data masking, sampling, and user opt-outs are typically in place to manage privacy and data volume. The specific configuration chosen by the extension's developers would determine the precise scope of data collection for any given user.
